Tuning a Stellar Radio - Updated Code October 11 2021

Steps for running StellarRadioAlgorithm.py: <br />
    1. Open terminal <br />
    2. Import alg class: "from StellarRadioAlgorithm import StellarRadioAlg" <br />
    3. Write "run = StellarRadioAlg()" to instantiate class <br />
    4. Run the "run_all_steps" function of the class by writing: "run.run_all_steps()" <br />
    5. The output is "stellar_radio_plot.pdf" <br />
    
Change KIC in config file. Next step is writing loop to go through many KICs one after another.
